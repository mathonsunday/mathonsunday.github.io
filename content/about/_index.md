I'm an experied mobile technical lead and international conference speaker. I love working in high growth companies on complex domains. 

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Included Health](https://includedhealth.com/.) Previously I was at [Compass](https://www.compass.com/), which I joined pre-IPO. 

I started my career as a full stack engineer at a startup called Bizo. One year after I started, Bizo was acquired by LinkedIn. I built my first iOS app as a side project and loved it. At the time I was interested in self-tracking and found that mobile apps unlocked astounding capabilities in this area. I was amazing by the potential use cases for mobile apps and decided I wanted to switch to iOS development. I moved to the New York City office to join the newly formed Video team as an iOS developer. During that time I was part of the launches for video sharing for all of LinkedIn and video stories.
