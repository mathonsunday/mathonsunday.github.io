## Welcome

After three years, the blog is back—and completely reimagined. This new version of Nerdonica represents a shift from traditional static site generators to a modern, component-based architecture that matches the aesthetic of my creative projects.

## What's New

### Modern Tech Stack

The blog now runs on **Next.js 15** with **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**. Instead of Hugo's templating system, we have a React-based design system built with glassmorphism, bioluminescent accents, and the deep-sea aesthetic from projects like visual-toolkit and creative-playground.

### LLM-Friendly Workflows

One of the goals was to make post creation seamless from an AI interface. Posts are simple Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml

title: "Your Title"
date: "2026-01-20"
excerpt: "Brief summary"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
author: "Veronica Ray"
featured: false
---
```

Just write Markdown, commit to git, and the site auto-deploys via GitHub Actions.

### Design Philosophy

The visual aesthetic draws from my creative work:

- **Dark foundations**: Very dark blues and grays (#0d0d12, #0f0f12)
- **Bioluminescent accents**: Cyan glows that feel organic and deep-sea
- **Glassmorphism**: Blurred backgrounds with subtle borders
- **Monospace typography**: JetBrains Mono with generous letter-spacing
- **Slow animations**: Glacial timing for a premium, organic feel

## The Deep Sea

The deep sea is a metaphor for creativity—mysterious, vast, and full of bioluminescent possibilities. Just like creatures in the abyss emit their own light, creative coding is about bringing light to dark canvases, crafting experiences that glow from within.

## What's Next

This blog is now a platform for exploring:

- **Software engineering** insights and DX improvements
- **Creative coding** techniques and visual effects
- **Design systems** and component architecture
- **Interactive experiences** built with React and Canvas

Each post can include:
- Code examples with syntax highlighting
- Embedded interactive demos
- Canvas-based animations
- Deep dives into technical concepts

## The Journey

Rewriting this blog from scratch was a great exercise in:

1. **Architectural decision-making**: Static export vs. serverless, MDX vs. Markdown, component design
2. **Aesthetic cohesion**: Translating the deep-sea theme across multiple projects into a unified design language
3. **Developer experience**: Making a system that's easy for both humans and AI to contribute to

Thanks for stopping by. The abyss awaits. 🌊
