      <description>Before my last day at LinkedIn I went to the Apple store in Grand Central to buy a new laptop. In my five years as a professional software developer I never had a personal laptop.
I purchased a 15 inch MacBook pro with a 2.6GHZ 6-Core processor and 512 GB of storage.
I already have a dotfiles repository so I can setup a new computer quickly and get back to work.</description>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been suffering from information overload.
It&amp;rsquo;s the WWDC 2016 videos and my backlog of blog posts to read and tools to try out. It&amp;rsquo;s all the newletters I subscribe to and books I&amp;rsquo;m trying to finish. It&amp;rsquo;s focusing on iOS development vs exposing myself to other languages and platforms.
For iOS development it makes sense to watch as many WWDC videos as I can.
However, as a well rounded software developer, understading git under the hood is a solid investment of my time.</description>
